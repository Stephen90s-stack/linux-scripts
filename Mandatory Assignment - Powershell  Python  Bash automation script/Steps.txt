Create a script to automate fileops on 4 remote servers. The task will entail
1. Connecting to servers (IP 10.20.12.08, 10.20.12.12, 10.20.12.21, 10.20.12.22) using
Username: admin Password: p@ssW0rd
2. Search for a file called reaper which can be running or dormant
3. Log the current location and PID of the file.
4. Delete this file
5. Replace with another file reaper with content “Deleted”
6. Log the current operations execution time.

Steps:

1. SetUp Ansible on the master system

	Assuming 10.20.12.08, 10.20.12.12, 10.20.12.21, 10.20.12.22 as slave
	
	Install ansible using following commands on master:
	
		apt-get update

		apt-get install software-properties-common

		apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

		apt-get update

		apt-get install ansible
		
	Edit Hosts file using:
	
	- vi /etc/ansible/hosts
	
	- create a group and add all private ip address of all slaves
	
	- vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config (Do these changes on both master and slave)
		Change:
			PermitRootLogin No => PermitRootLogin Yes
			PasswordAuthenthication No => PasswordAuthenthication Yes
	- service sshd restart (Execute on both master and slave)
		
2. Execute Scripts on master
	- Create a file iplist.txt and add all ip, user and password
	- Generating id_rsa.pub: ssh-keygen -t rsa
	- Copy iplist.txt test1.sh test2.sh, test3.sh in a directory
	- bash test1.sh (Copies id_rsa.pub on all slaves using ssh-copy-id to avoid entering password and execute a smooth ssh connection)
	- time bash test2.sh reaper (Find the reaper file => Logs it location => Deletes it => And Replaces it with new file => Prints total execution time)
