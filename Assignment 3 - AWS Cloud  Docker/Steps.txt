Create a script would run docker container image registry.webuy.com/mywebserver on port
5000. Assuming this docker container is running on two AWS EC2 instances, create a cloud
formation template, which will create a AWS ELB which will load balance traffic to both the
instance


1. Execute bash test5.sh on both Ec2 instances to deploy the application on port 5000
  #! /bin/bash

  docker pull registry.webuy.com/mywebserver:latest

  docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name testcont registry.webuy.com/mywebserver:latest

2. Execute ALBLoadBalancer.yaml on AWS cloudformation console
    - Enter Environement name
    - Enter the VPC in which the load needs to be deployed
    - Enter the security group
    - Enter the instance ID (i-xyx) of first and second instance on which the application is deployed
    - Listener, TargetGroup and an internet facing loadBalancer will be created using the .yaml file
    - Copy the load balancer DNS and append 5000 as port as the application needs to be access on port 5000 and put it on browser
