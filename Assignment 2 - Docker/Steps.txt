Create a bash script to create a docker container which will host a static website. Container
needs to be portable and needs to run on port 80. Publish the newly created container to the
private repository hosted on “registry.webuy.com”. Assume anonymous authentication to the
docker registry. Also save the newly created docker image as tar ball file

Execute bash test4.sh

#! /bin/bash

docker pull nginx  (Pulls docker image with static website hosted)

docker run -it --rm -d -p 80:80 --name web nginx (Create container from image and is mapped to port 80 to access the application)

docker commit web newimage (Creates image from container)

docker save newimage | gzip > myimage_latest.tar.gz (Create tar file of image)

docker tag newimage registry.webuy.com/mywebserver:test (Tage the image to push to remove repository)

docker push registry.webuy.com/mywebserver:test (push docker image to remote docker repository)
